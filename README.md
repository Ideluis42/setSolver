# Fundamental Theorem of Set Solver

## Fundamental Theorem of Set:
The Fundamental Theorem of Set states that if you draw two cards from a deck of SET there is one unique card within the remaining cards that completes the set.

## The Code:
This program applies the fundamental theorem of SET by drawing two cards from a deck of SET cards (where each card has three attributes) and finds the third card that makes the SET. You need Python to run the program. You can install Python using:
  
    pip install python3
  
 You can run the code using:
   
    python solver.py
